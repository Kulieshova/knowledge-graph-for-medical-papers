anxious depression associated with poorer treatment outcome with antidepressant monotherapy,Depression Side effect Slower response to treatment,"Score: 0.75

anxious depression less effective antidepressant treatment in achieving remission compared to nonanxious depression,Depression Side effect Slower response to treatment,"Score: 0.75
The LLM output contains some inaccuracies as it mentions anxious depression and achieving remission, which were not present in the ground truth statement, but overall captures the idea that depression may lead to a slower response to treatment.",0.75
"anxious depression associated with higher side effect frequency, intensity, and burden",Depression Side effect Mortality,"Score: 0.75
LLM Output correctly identifies a relationship between depression and side effects, but includes anxiety which was not mentioned in the ground truth.",0.75
