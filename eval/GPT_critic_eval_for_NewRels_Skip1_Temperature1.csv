the qids-sr criteria.

never married; and among those with less education,
those with public insurance, and those with lesser income.
patients with more severe depression at baseline (as mea-

glutamatergic agents highly effective major depressive disorder treatment,"research on 
the development of new antidepressants should explore several mechanisms of action 
on several types of receptors: antagonism, inhibition of the reuptake of neurotrans-
mitters, and modulators of glutamate receptors, as well as interactions with α-amino-3-
acid receptors, hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic, brain-derived neurotrophic 
factor, tyrosine kinase b receptor (the mechanistic target of rapamycin), and glycogen 
synthase kinase-3[72].
identifying the cellular targets of rapid-acting agents like ketamine could help 
practitioners develop more effective antidepressant molecules by revealing other 
receptors involved in gamma-aminobutyric acid regulation and glutamate trans-
mission[73].

sertraline highly effective treatment for depression,"for both endpoints—remis-
sion as defined by the ham-d and by the qids-sr—the
total score of the ham-d anxiety/somatization factor was
the best predictor (average r2=0.020), followed closely by
the total score of the ham-d psychic and somatic anxiety
items (average r2=0.016), and then by whether anxious
depression was present (average r2=0.015) and whether
any comorbid anxiety disorders were present (average
r2=0.014).
patients with anxious depression had a greater reduc-
tion in anxiety/somatization scores than those with
nonanxious depression, but they also had greater residual
symptoms of anxiety/somatization at endpoint than those
without anxious depression (see supplementary table 2 in
the online supplement).

as a result of the cross-tabulations of remission (defined
with either the ham-d or the qids-sr) with each possible
threshold on the ham-d anxiety/somatization factor (see
supplementary figures 1 and 2 in the online supplement).
from these analyses, it appears that the specificity drops
off quickly.

placebo-controlled 
antidepressant trials and its eﬀ ect on apparent eﬃ  cacy is

this topic 147 placebo-controlled trials are mainly designed 
for regulatory approval purposes; to meet both ethical 
and safety requirements, they tend to recruit patients 
with a mild form of disease.148 although placebo-controlled 
trials can be eﬃ  cient because they need smaller sample 
sizes than non-placebo-controlled trials, diﬃ  culties in 
carrying out these trials when eﬀ ective treatments are 
known to exist can introduce artifacts into clinical 
trials.149
response to placebo across antidepressant trials has 
been shown to vary and has clearly increased in the past 
two decades, with a similar increase occurring in the 
fraction of patients responding to active medication as 
well.150 the issue of changes in trial outcomes over time is 
still under debate;151 however, the change in placebo 
response does not seem to be directly explained by changes 
in study characteristics.150 inﬂ ation of baseline severity, for 
example, is likely to be a cause for the temporal rise in 
placebo response rates, which increases the proportion of 
failed trials.150 as placebo-controlled trials of antidepressants

The LLM output correctly defines venlafaxine as a serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor used to treat major depressive disorder, but lacks specific details such as dosage or side effects.",0.85
anxious depression results poorer acute outcomes,"rat-
ings of side effect frequency, intensity,
and burden, as well as the number of se-
rious adverse events, were significantly
greater in the anxious depression group.
similarly, in level 2, patients with anxious
depression fared significantly worse in
both the switching and augmentation op-
tions.
conclusions: anxious depression is asso-
ciated with poorer acute outcomes than
nonanxious depression following antide-
pressant treatment.

The LLM output is correct in stating that anxious depression is more common than nonanxious depression, as shown by the data presented in the ground truth statement.",0.9
anxious depression associated with more medical comorbidity,"for both endpoints—remis-
sion as defined by the ham-d and by the qids-sr—the
total score of the ham-d anxiety/somatization factor was
the best predictor (average r2=0.020), followed closely by
the total score of the ham-d psychic and somatic anxiety
items (average r2=0.016), and then by whether anxious
depression was present (average r2=0.015) and whether
any comorbid anxiety disorders were present (average
r2=0.014).
patients with anxious depression had a greater reduc-
tion in anxiety/somatization scores than those with
nonanxious depression, but they also had greater residual
symptoms of anxiety/somatization at endpoint than those
without anxious depression (see supplementary table 2 in
the online supplement).
we examined the sensitivity versus specificity obtained
as a result of the cross-tabulations of remission (defined
with either the ham-d or the qids-sr) with each possible
threshold on the ham-d anxiety/somatization factor (see
supplementary figures 1 and 2 in the online supplement).
from these analyses, it appears that the specificity drops
off quickly.
we also plotted the number of anxiety symptoms ac-
cording to the ham-d anxiety/somatization factor versus
the percentage of patients achieving remission as defined
by either the ham-d or the qids-sr criterion (see figure
2; see also supplementary figure 3 in the online supple-
ment)","Score: 0.90
The LLM output correctly summarizes the findings related to anxious depression and medical comorbidity.",0.9
anxious depression results more serious adverse events than nonanxious depression group,"rat-
ings of side effect frequency, intensity,
and burden, as well as the number of se-
rious adverse events, were significantly
greater in the anxious depression group.
similarly, in level 2, patients with anxious
depression fared significantly worse in
both the switching and augmentation op-
tions.
conclusions: anxious depression is asso-
ciated with poorer acute outcomes than
nonanxious depression following antide-
pressant treatment.

anxious depression associated with serious adverse event and intolerance,"based on
prior reports (26), we used thresholds with a 90% specificity in re-

terview to define the presence of concomitant axis i disorders.
current general medical conditions were assessed by the 14-item
cumulative illness rating scale (21, 28); for this instrument, a
manual (29) was used to guide scoring.
the research outcome assessors, blind to treatments and work-
ing from locations separate from clinical sites, conducted telephone
interviews to complete the ham-d and the 30-item clinician-rating
version of the inventory of depressive symptomatology (23, 30).
responses to items on these measures were used to estimate the
presence of atypical (31), melancholic (32), and anxious (6) symp-
tom features.
an interactive voice response system (33) was used to collect
data from patients on their health perceptions (with the 12-item
short form health survey [34]), quality of life (with the quality of
life enjoyment and satisfaction questionnaire [35]), and occupa-
tional and interpersonal adjustment (with the work and social
adjustment scale [36]).

in level 2 of star*d, 1,292 adult outpatients with major
depressive disorder who had no remission of symptoms in
level 1 or could not tolerate citalopram (in the case of the
switch option only) were randomly assigned either to
switch (overall n=727) to sustained-release bupropion (at
a maximal daily dose of 400 mg; n=239), sertraline (at a
maximal daily dose of 200 mg; n=238), or extended-re-
lease venlafaxine (at a maximal daily dose of 375 mg; n=
250) or to continue taking citalopram and receive aug-
mentation (overall n=565) with sustained-release bupro-
pion (at a dose of up to 400 mg per day; n=279) or bus-
pirone (at a dose of up to 60 mg per day; n=286)","Score: 0.90

major depressive disorder (mdd) subset all depression,"a treatment manual, initial didactic instruction, ongoing

use of a structured evaluation of depressive symptoms and side

vide consistent, high-quality care (37; see also www.star-d.org).
safety assessments
to monitor side effects and serious adverse events, a multi-
tiered approach (39) was used, involving the clinical research co-
ordinators, the study clinicians, the interactive voice response
system, the clinical manager, safety officers, regional center di-
rectors, and the national institute of mental health’s data safety
and monitoring board.
concomitant medications
concomitant treatments for current general medical condi-
tions, for associated symptoms of depression (e.g., sleep and agi-
tation), and for citalopram’s side effects were permitted, based on
clinical judgment, at study entry or during the treatments.
